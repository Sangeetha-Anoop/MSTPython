<h2>More than day care</h2>
<p>You want to do what's best for your child by giving them a strong start in their early education. You're in the right place! </p>
<p>We're the experts in educating and caring for children and families. So, if you're looking for the best place for your child to learn and grow (when you can't be there), there is no better choice than KIDSCLUB! </p>
<h2>Here's How We'll Earn Your Confidence</h2>
<p>We're ready to welcome your child early in the morning, and we extend past most other daycares' hours to make drop-off and pick-up times fit with your schedule.</p>
<p>Full- and part-time scheduling is an option at most locations*, and our KinderCare App keeps you connected to your little one's experience all day long. </p>
<h2>Our Approach To Education</h2>
<p>While your child is very young, every learning moment counts! That's why our child care programs put education first—even for the tiniest babies—because every adorable coo, crawl, and creation is proof that they're ready for more than just daycare. 
Instead of pulling an existing curriculum off the shelf, we have a dedicated Education team that builds (and refines) our own research-based curriculum to meet the needs of your little learner. They've knit together the best parts of leading educational philosophies to make one standout approach you won't find anywhere but KIDSCLUB. </p>
